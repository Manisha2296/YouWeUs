					<p>Our brain is functioning almost every second - processing a lot of thoughts, taking care of our movements and a lot more. It is working even when we are asleep which means it requires good amount of fuel to run and by fuel, I mean the food we consume.
					Just like an expensive car requires premium fuel to function well, our brain requires good amount of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants to nourish itself. Studies have shown that the kind of food we eat guides our emotions. It has been scientifically proven that cutting intake of a lot of processed foods on a regular basis and consuming probiotics can help reduce stress levels, anxiety and improve mental outlook. <br>
					So watch out for your diet! Eat right, feel amazing! </p>

					<div class="imagedesc group">
					<p>Life can get tedious, disastrous, traumatic, monotonous and much more. It's your responsibility to realise that every second of your life matters and take accountability for tuning it better. We are so busy chasing our dreams, making our life perfect that we often forget to enjoy the little joys in life. They easily go unnoticed.
					Take a pause, observe and analyse those little things everyday, it will definitely fill in so much happiness and positivity within you and makes you confident enough to get through everyday battles.
					<br>Keep going ! </p>

					<div class="imagedesc group">
					<p>Life is going to keep throwing challenges at you everyday. You need to believe in yourself, step up and take as many risks as possible. Life is too short to not give anything a shot, so make everyday count. Just remember, it can atmost be a bad day, not a bad life!
					<br>Keep smiling, it will brighten up your day as well someone else's too! </p>

					<div class="imagedesc group">
					<p>It is important to conquer the battle of being alone. Solitude aids in avoiding the negativity and adversity around and helps you to focus on yourself. When you're in a web of mess , it is important to accept it, as acceptance makes you realise you need to push yourself out of it , which eventually helps you in invoking the sense of healing from within. Healing is vital for growth. Learn to heal for yourself so that you can help people around you heal too. </p>

					<div class="imagedesc group">
					<p>Sometimes our mind is so clogged , everything feels hazy , it becomes hard to comprehend but..that's okay. It's only human to feel so. You just need to take a deep breath, try to let go of things one breath at a time . Things happen but dwelling in them is the worst thing you could do to yourself.
					YOU need to be hopeful. WE need to be hopeful. </p>
